# A "Heads or Tails" game in Rust.
This is a learning project, a Rust "Heads or Tails" game with some visual enhancements.

_Some visual enhancements included in the code may not be correctly shown if the default terminal in your OS isn't modern like [this one](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=pt-br&gl=BR), but there's a version in "Releases" that doesn't include the visual enhancements if you prefer_

# Download and Execution:
- Go to "Releases" and download the latest "HeadsOrTails.exe" _or "HeadsOrTails-noAnimation.exe"_ available;
- There's no need for installation, just execute the file in your computer.
